# PRNGS-in-Python

In this work, 7 of the main random generators in the Python programming language were evaluated. The list of generators was classified as found on the first 40 sites of the Bing, DuckDuck Go and Google Search engines. The search word was “prng examples in Python”. The generators evaluated include: random, numpy.random, os.urandom, getrandbits (also known as sharandom), blum-blum-shub, numpy.random_intel and mersenne-twister. It is worth emphasizing that random includes randint and systemrandom generators.The search result resulted in 70 random (84.4%), 5 numpy.random (6.0%), 4 os.urandom (4.8%), 1 getrandbits (1.2%), 1 blum-blum -shub (1.2%), 1 numpy.random_intel (1.2%) and 1 mersenne-twister (1.2%).For each of the found generators, a python version was implemented, generating 100,000 numbers in the range 0 to 10,000, with fixed execution parameters.During the tests of generation of pseudo-random numbers, the execution time was collected. With these data, a bar graph was generated in GNUPLOT, which represents the execution time in seconds on the ordinate axis, and the PRNGs tested on the abscissa axis. In addition, the BLUM BLUM SHUB generator, for carrying out other randomness tests, obtained a longer time than the others, being about 204 times slower than its predecessor (SYSTEM RANDOM).
